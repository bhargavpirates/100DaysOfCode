Django TUtorial:
================

Have MVT Model (Model View Template)

Django SetUP:
-------------
my machine is windows
so i setup django according to my OS

DjangoFramework  is a Python Based langugae
So we need Python in our PC to work with DjangoforFramework

Install -  Python 3.6
Install VirtaulENV
using : pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
than setpup env :: mkvirtualenv test

setup django ::
pip install django

django-admin --version


Creating Project:
-----------------
mkdir djangoProjects
cd  djangoProjects

django-admin startproject bhargavDjango

cd bhargavDjango
ls

then we can see (folder bhargavDjango,file manage.py )
folder bhargavDjango contains :: __init__,settings,urls(handle urls),wsgi(used to deploy project on the server)

we can run this project even though we didnot deployed
because Django gives us lightweight server

python manage.py runserver
then it give local IPADDRESS : 
and we can see your code frintend on that local server



Frist APP in Django:
--------------------
Static Content : HTML,CSS,Javascript
Dynamic Content : Django

we can have different apps in one project

**For entire Django Coding i am using VisualStudio Editor**
in visula studio there will be terimal option there we can use cmdprmt,python env there
BUT  we want to work on virtual env :: then in VS-terminal type WORKON <virtualenv_name>


then type :: python manage.py startapp calc
 then we will get calc folder in our existing Project
 
 APP Folder Consist of :
 __init__.py,admin.py,apps.py,models.py(used to hlold data),tests.py,views.py(handle request) files
 

HOW DJANGO NAVIGATE:
--------------------
when we request to our url then it will search for url mappings in our main folder(bhargavDjango/wurls.py) ie
/,/website/x,/website/x/y etc

there it will check for the url paths if its finds one it will navigate to that path
eg :: urlpatterns = [path('',include('calc.urls')),path('admin/', admin.site.urls),]
Explanation of eg: it found that at "/" or " " at home page go to calc.urls path


in calc.urls:: 
urlpatterns = [path('',views.home,name='home')]

then it think that in home page we need to call  this views.home function
that is called as REQUEST
we need to send RESPONSEfor that request using below code format

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("helloWorld")
    

now refresh your local host in any of webrowser:
output:: helloWorld


Django Template Language (DTL)
-------------------------------

in django Dynamic Content can be done using HTML pages by TEMPLATES
ie
in Template we can have html pages which we can make  dynamic them


CReate template Folder:
and there write file.html

to reflect those changes in code ::

go to main bhargavDjango/settings there go to templates varbile
and change the DIR varible value
ie 'DIRS' : [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')]
and go to views.py file and change by adding html file using RENDER MEthod
ie by
def home(request):
    return render(request,'home.html')
    

For dynamic value use::
def home(request):
    return render(request,'home.html,{'name':'Bhargav'})

and change that value in html also::
<h1>Hello {{name}} !!!</h1>


Django Template Language (DTL) Part2
-------------------------------------
create another file in Templates Folder

file create and  press ! and click enter
you get predefined code

and now change backgroundcolor

<body bgcolor='cyan'> 
    {% block content %}

    {% endblock %}
 </body> 
 
and include this change in the home.html :::
 
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Hello {{name}} !!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
{% endblock %}
 
 
 
Check its output:

Adding TWO Numbers in Django:
-----------------------------
here we are doing Operation in our webpages

for that we need form and get numbers to do ADD Oprtion on that

<form action="add">
    Enter 1st number : <input type="text" name="num1"><br>
    Enter 2nd Number : <input type="text" name ="num2"><br>
    <input type="submit">
</form>

now when we click on Submit button it need add two numbers

but where do you do ADDITION Operation ??
where you will print its result??

2. 
For printing results we are creating another file.html
and printing result
1.
to do opertion we need to create another file in view
and add urls in url.py
ie by  path('add',views.add,name='add')

def add(request):
    val1  = request.GET['num1']
    val2  = request.GET['num2']
    res = int(val1)+int(val2)
    return render(request,"result.html",{'result':res})
